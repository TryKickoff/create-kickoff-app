# create-kickoff-app

This package includes the global command for [Create Kickoff App](https://github.com/trykickoff/create-kickoff-app).<br>

It is a custom fork of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which in addition to the original feature set also includes the [Kickoff](https://github.com/trykickoff/kickoff) front-end framework and the ability to compile SCSS files.

It is in active development and will change over time.

For more information, please refer to the original project's documentation:

* [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create Kickoff App.
